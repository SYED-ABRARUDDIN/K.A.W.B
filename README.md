# Autonomous Robot with Differential Drive and RP Lidar - Undergraduate Major Project

Welcome to the GitHub repository for an autonomous robot developed as my undergraduate major project. This project focuses on designing and implementing a robot that utilizes a differential drive system, RP Lidar, and the Robot Operating System (ROS) for advanced autonomy and perception capabilities.

## Features
- **Differential drive system:** The robot is equipped with a differential drive configuration, enabling precise control and maneuverability. This drive system allows the robot to navigate through different environments efficiently.
- **RP Lidar:** The robot incorporates an RP Lidar sensor, which provides accurate and high-resolution 360-degree environmental perception. The Lidar sensor enables the robot to perceive its surroundings and generate a detailed map for autonomous navigation.
- **ROS integration:** The project utilizes ROS, a flexible framework for writing robot software. ROS provides a wide range of libraries and tools that facilitate the development of robot systems, including perception, control, and navigation. The codebase in this repository is organized according to ROS conventions and follows best practices.
- **Autonomous navigation:** The goal of this project is to develop an autonomous navigation system for the robot. Using the sensor data from the RP Lidar and the capabilities of ROS, the robot will be able to perceive its environment, plan its path, and navigate autonomously, avoiding obstacles and reaching target destinations.
